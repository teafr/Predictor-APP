# Predictor desktop application

### How does application work?
You have to write down your Name and ask something like: "Would I get a job tomorrow after interview?".
Then you'll get a MessageBox with random prediction.
If you leave TextField empty, you'll get a MessageBox which will tell you to fill in your Name.

### Tecnical info
This Windows Forms Application contains JSON file, which has all kinds of predictions.
Also I added SetUp project, so some of my friends have already tried my app on their computers.

### Where you can find it
Project is located in the branch "Predictor_app". 
In the folder "Predictor" you'll find "work with forms" which contains main part of my project.

### How it looks like
