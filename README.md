# Predictor desktop application

### How does application work?
You have to write down your Name and ask something like: "Would I get a job tomorrow after interview?".
Then you'll get a MessageBox with random prediction.
If you leave TextField empty, you'll get a MessageBox which will tell you to fill in your Name.

### What for?
You can use it when you can't decide what to do or you simply want to predict your future for fun. 

### How it looks like:

### Tecnical info
This Windows Forms Application contains JSON file, which has all kinds of predictions.
Also I added SetUp project, so some of my friends have already tried my app on their computers.
